Bugs I found on installsield project:
- all drivers are missing w10 and server19 installers
- RegisterTool dosent work, I looked into the registry on SOFTWARE\\RedHat\\RHEV\\Tools\\ but the only one being registered is SSO
Balloon:
      - if blnsvr -i failes the installation continue and finishs succsesfully.
spice_agent:
      we are getting the package "vdagent-win" which containes the .exe
      files, and we unpack them to xp/w7 folders and in the ism project
      we tell installShield to take the files from the w7/xp folders
      but we install the agent on all the oses (look into the file Osbehavior
       on the main installer) that is vety confusing.
netkvm:
- missing dlls on w8
SSO:
- I saw that by Osbehavior SSO needs to be installed on win8/8.1/10
      vut the conditions all puit os as OS=win7  even if the os is 8/8.1/10
      it is a confusing workaround.
--------------------------------------------------------
TODO:
1. Get a way to build in Linux, with msitools or wine.
2. Add ICONS to the installer.
4. Set Cited properties http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa370905%28v=VS.85%29.aspx Chapter 3.
5. Create a brew build script.
6. Think about adding INSTALLED to and REMOVED to the component conditions
7. Think about adding -sadmin, -sadv, -slocto, -sv, -usf, -cub the light linker.
8. Add support for win 2019.
9. on RHV-Agent in the install agent function there is a string replacement, basically replace
      "ovirt-guest-agent.log" with PROGRAMFILES^"Redhat\\RHEV\\Tools\\InstallLogs\\Install.ovirt-guest-agent-service.log"
      when I'll have a log dit maybe I need to do something similar.
10. on RHV-Agent I have some CA that I need to investigate.
11. What to do with QGA (rhewv-qga.smi)
12. on rhev-agent ResetPeriodInDays="1" needs to select currect one.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Balloon - DONE!!!
Qemufwcfg - DONE!!!
